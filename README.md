OpenSFZ
=======

An Open SFZ player & SF2 (Sampler) based on SFZero, without the Juce dependency

Note, this is still in development and only has minimal functionality right now. 
Contributions to handle additional SFZ opcodes, more file formats, better resampling etc, are welcome.

Documentation and examples are coming soon.
